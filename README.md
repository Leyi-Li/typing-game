Balckhole Speed Typing

Our project is a speed typing game. There is a black hole that you are preventing the words to be sucked in. Type the words to earn points. The amount of points earned are depended on the length of the words. Each time a word get sucked into the black hole, you lose a live. You have 3 lives total. Any words that goes outside of the screen but not into the black hole are counted as -2 points to your total score. Get as many points as you can while practicing typing coding-related words.
