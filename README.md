Our project is a speed typing game. When a word comes on screen it is sucked towards the blackhole. You have until the time that the word touches the blackhole to type it correctly and press enter. In game mode 1 you you have 60 seconds and 1 life. The goal is to enter as many words correctly as you can in the time limit. Game mode 2 you have 2 lives but no time limit. Try and go for as long as you can.
